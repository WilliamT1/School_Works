Original run time with 30000 numbers: .33s

After changing array from int to char: It took way less time to find all the primes. It found 15 primes and only took .001s compared to the .33s it took for the ints.

After changing array from char to bool: It didn't find any primes, and as a result it took 0s to run the program.

After changing from static array to dynamic array: It took .010s longer to find all the primes using dynamic arrays as it had to fill the array first.

After changing from dynamic array to vector: It took the same amount of time to find all primes using dynamic arrays as it did for vectors.
