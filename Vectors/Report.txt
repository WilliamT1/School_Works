Question 24b

This one was just like 24A with the exception that you had to use a 2d vector rather than 1d. I had to initialize a 2d vector and then resize it to the proper row and column size. Then I fed it into an overloaded version of the sum() function that was originally used to sum up the normal 2d array and it worked like a charm because vectors use similar sintax to arrays.
